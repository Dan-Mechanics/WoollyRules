rotate planet
scissors 3d works
implement shader assets

future thing maybe: namespaces for different people working in project ???

under description github desktop --> add co-auther might seem useful for what im doing but its public anyway so who cares.

fun idea: add shaker.cs but like random spam when point at bear and blinking scissor curser to give the effect of dont cut the bear.

///

refactor pointer.cs name. VV
scene naming could be better
implement planet shader.

Scissors backend different from scissors model.

camera pivot.pos and the planet pos need to be the same.

---

still got to add the animation to the scissor graphic in the world.

fix the planet round surface not blockey.

schaar animatie when cutting

---

implement luuk sheep model

---

i dont have the power cable i cant really do much atm
what i would like to do is make it so that the forward works better
and thats basically it.s

---

to ask : i need better scissor cursor thing. --> ask #art channel and then send ur cursor file with dimensions so they can make it a little bit better.
wont have that DIY indie feel anymore tho but whatever.

todo for this day ish:
scissor orientation hotfix VVV
webcam preload bool and recording icon topright. VVV
sheep and planet orientation. --> i be needing that sheep model kinda soon tho, espcially for splliting logic. VVV
scissors actually respond like cursor. VVV
dont make ICuttable its too much hastle because you have inheritance anyway VVV

blinkingtext and blinking are same thing. VVV

add prefabs folder VVV

FIX: It could maybe make more sense if the position of this object is used as reference. --> prefabspawner.cs
